Considering SAG’s limited vehicle space as well as your own sanity (trust me!), please pack discerningly.\nPros suggest packing everything you think you’ll need, then coming back a few days later to pare it down significantly. Some even encourage riders to pack just two of each type of clothing and do some quick sink-laundry each night.\nRider Packing List\nSAG Packing List"
